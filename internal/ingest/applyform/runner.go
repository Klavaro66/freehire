	LeaseSeconds int
	// MaxAttempts bounds the retries before a capture is dead-lettered.
	MaxAttempts int

	// stopping a backlog drain from becoming a flood aimed at one platform.
	Concurrency int
	// MaxPerRun bounds how much of the backlog ONE run takes; 0 is unbounded.
	//
	// Concurrency limits how fast, this limits how long, and the second bound is the one
	// that matters operationally. Nothing here holds a lock — what keeps a cron worker
	// from stacking on itself is systemd refusing to start a second instance of a
	// Type=oneshot unit while the first is active. So a run that works through a 185k
	// backlog for hours does not merely take a long time: it silently swallows every
	// scheduled firing behind it while ingest keeps enqueueing. Bounded, the cron cadence
	// is what sets throughput, which is where that decision belongs.

// Before this package's migration onto internal/platform/outbox, the implementation
// contradicted that documented intent: a dead-lettered capture incremented BOTH
// Failed and DeadLettered (a pre-existing double-count this doc comment's "apart
// from" never described). internal/platform/outbox.Outcome is structurally one-outcome-per-
// item, so migrating onto it corrects Failed/DeadLettered to the mutually exclusive
// counters already documented here — matching how enrich/embed/search-drain already
// counted them. Found and fixed by code review, not the original design.

// Degraded reports whether a run deserves an alert, and it deliberately does NOT use the

//
// That rule — non-zero on any per-item failure — fits a worker whose items rarely fail. This
// one issues hundreds of thousands of requests to other companies' APIs, where a handful of
// transient failures per run is the normal, healthy shape: the queue retries them, and the
// first production run measured 10 in 2490. Marking that degraded paints the unit red on
// nearly every firing, and a status that is always red carries no information.
//
// What does deserve an alert is work ABANDONED rather than postponed: a dead letter is a
// capture nobody will look at again. And a run that captured nothing at all while failing is
// not a blip either — that is the platform being gone, and it must not hide behind the same

// cancelAwareClaimer adapts Store to outbox.Claimer, checking ctx.Err() before every

// failing, so stopping here — rather than letting the next claim attempt or per-item
// fetch surface the cancellation as an ordinary error — keeps a cancelled run from
// burning the remaining attempts of a large backlog on a shutdown, matching the
// original behavior's post-wave ctx.Err() check (an empty claim is outbox.RunPool's
// ordinary clean-stop path, so this reproduces it without RunPool needing to know
// about cancellation).
//
// The first call is deliberately NOT guarded: the original loop called Claim
// unconditionally before ever checking ctx, so an already-cancelled ctx at the very
// start of Run() still made one real claim attempt (surfacing as a claim error if the
// store's own call respects the cancellation) rather than a silent zero-stats no-op.
// Guarding every call uniformly — including the first — would swap that visible
// failure signal for a clean-looking empty-queue run, indistinguishable from a
// healthy drain; found by code review, not by design.
