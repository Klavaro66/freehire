// Package silence holds the ladder of how long an application may go unanswered at each
// stage, and the arithmetic under it. It lives apart from internal/application/userjob because the
// ghost signal judges a POSTING by how long the applications against it have been silent,
// and a posting is not an application — so the ladder has to sit below both.

// Silence states. An application reports one of these, or the empty string when
// it is settled and so waiting on nobody — a caller must be able to tell "not
// waiting" from "waiting and fine", which a reassuring `active` would hide.

	Active = "active"
	// Silent is an application past it.

	// awaiting the user's confirmation — a question to answer, not a verdict.
	Unconfirmed = "unconfirmed"

// thresholds is how many days of silence each active stage tolerates,
// growing stricter as the application advances (TestSilenceThresholdsGrowStricter
// pins that direction). Terminal stages are absent: a settled application never
// accrues silence.
//
// The values do not share a provenance, and a table of five specific numbers
// reads as measurement whether or not it is one, so each carries its own:
//
//	applied   21  measured — 92 observed applications, marks 16% of them
//	screening 18  interpolated between the measured anchors
//	responded 15  interpolated between the measured anchors
//	interview 12  measured — 6 observed applications, marks 3. Raised from 7,
//	              which marked 5 of the 6: a badge on nearly every card is one
//	              nobody reads.
//	offer      5  judgement, from a job seeker's experience. No application in
//	              the sample has reached this stage; the single message ever
//	              classified an offer is genuine but from a job search three
//	              years earlier and informs nothing.
//	preparing 21  never reached in practice — TrackedJob.Silence() short-circuits
//	              on AppliedAt == nil, which is guaranteed for `preparing` (see
//	              cv-tailoring's board placement). Present only because
//	              TestSilenceThresholdsCoverExactlyTheActiveStages requires every
//	              ranked stage to carry one; copies `applied`'s value as the
//	              nearest meaningful anchor rather than inventing a new one.
//
// The interpolated pair steps evenly by three days between 21 and 12 rather than
// taking distinct-looking values, so the shape of the ladder shows at a glance
// which rungs were derived rather than observed. Revisit the middle three once
// the sample grows.
//
// All values are calendar days, which sets a floor under the strictest: five is
// the shortest span that always contains two working days, while three can be
// consumed entirely by a weekend. Going below five needs business-day
// arithmetic — its own calendar, holidays and employer time zone.
