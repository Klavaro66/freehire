// botMarkers are lowercased substrings of well-known crawler/preview User-Agents.
// The list is deliberately small and conservative: it catches the high-volume
// crawlers that hit SSR pages for SEO and link previews, not every possible bot.
// Missed bots only inflate the page-view number (a transparency figure), so this
// stays a light filter rather than an exhaustive blocklist.
//
// The generic "bot" is deliberately absent, mirroring internal/platform/tracerlink's own
// classifier: it appears inside "CUBOT," a phone brand, so a bare substring match
// misclassifies a real visitor's page view as a crawler's. Generic bot names
// (googlebot, bingbot, ahrefsbot, ...) are caught by botSuffixes instead.

// botSuffixes catch the general shape of a bot's name — "…bot" followed by a version
// separator, as in "Googlebot/2.1" or "bingbot;" — without claiming every product
// whose name happens to contain those three letters (see botMarkers).
