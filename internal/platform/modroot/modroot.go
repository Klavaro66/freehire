// Package modroot locates the module root by walking up from the working directory to the
// directory holding go.mod.
//
// It exists for the handful of tests that police a rule across the whole repository — that
// only one package classifies a SQLSTATE, that background entrypoints never resolve a
// user's LLM credential, that every pool-opening command shares one bootstrap. Each walks
// a tree rooted somewhere above its own package, and each used to count "../" to get
// there. A counted depth is silent when it is wrong in the safe-looking direction: the
// walk simply covers less of the repo and the guard keeps passing.
