// This is NOT a convenience: a canonical is not automatically an alias of itself.
// "golang" resolves to "go", but the bare token "go" appears nowhere in the alias
// tables — deliberately, because Parse reads prose where "go" is an English verb.
// The assistant, however, is instructed in its system prompt to speak canonical
// slugs ("go, react, kubernetes"), so without this tier the single most common
// backend skill would be dropped from every atom the agent recorded, silently.
// Parse is unaffected: it never consults this set.
//
// resumeAcronyms' canonicals are deliberately excluded, even when a phrase alias also
// names the same canonical (e.g. "rag", reachable via the safe, unambiguous long form
// "retrieval augmented generation"): letting the BARE canonical pass through here would
// bypass the résumé-only acronym gate exactly the way the cased acronym pass is gated,
// since a job-side n-gram caller (cvmatch) can hand over the bare token just as easily
// as the acronym itself. The long phrase itself stays reachable through phraseExact,
// untouched by this — it is unambiguous in either context. canonicalSetResume covers
// the bare form, gated behind WithResumeAcronyms.

// Canonicalize resolves caller-supplied skill tokens to canonical slugs, sorted and
// deduplicated, returning nil when none resolve. It is the explicit-assertion entry
// to the same dictionary Parse mines free text with, and it differs from Parse in
// exactly one way: the corroboration rule does not apply.
//
// That rule exists because Parse reads prose, where "react" is more likely the
// English verb than the framework unless a strong tech token corroborates it. A
// token a caller hands over — a user ticking a skill, an agent recording an atom's
// skill list — is an assertion about a skill, not a sentence to be interpreted, so
// requiring corroboration would silently drop skills their owner explicitly stated.
//
// The "never guess" rule is unchanged: a token outside the dictionary emits nothing
// rather than passing through as a pseudo-canonical. Nor does Canonicalize mine: a
// token must resolve as a WHOLE (as an acronym, a word alias, or a phrase alias),
// so handing it a sentence yields nothing — that is Parse's job.
//
// The zero set is job-safe (default), mirroring Parse: the résumé-scoped acronym
// tier (resumeAcronyms, e.g. RAG) is OFF unless a caller passes WithResumeAcronyms(),
// because tokens Canonicalize resolves are not always a candidate's own — cvmatch
// canonicalizes n-grams mined from a VACANCY's requirement text, where a résumé-only
// acronym would collide with the same letters' job-side meaning.
