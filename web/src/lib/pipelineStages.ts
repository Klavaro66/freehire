// The stages a posting passes through before it's searchable, roughly in the order a
// reader should follow them — "roughly" because it isn't a strict single-pass pipeline:
// deduplicate (below) actually runs at two different points, which is why the page
// doesn't number these. Written from docs/architecture.md and the root AGENTS.md; kept
// in one file so the page's copy and its illustration registry
// (pipeline/StageIllustration.svelte) cannot name a stage that has no picture, or draw
// one nothing describes.

That is deliberate — a facet built on a guess degrades quietly, and quietly is the one way a filter is allowed to fail here.',

Ingest itself never stores the same posting from the same source twice; separately, a later pass clusters near-duplicate postings by role and company across different boards and collapses them into one — including the aggregator's copy of a job we already have straight from the source. You see one listing; where it's actually posted is still there for you to check.",
